Projet Autenticator – https://effortless-empanada-ad1e86.netlify.app/

# 💡 The brief

For this week's project, we were tasked to create a backend and frontend that should authenticate users and handle passwords using tokens. We had to securely store the passwords in our database, with security and defensive design in mind. We needed to build a registration flow and understand how to create the frontend and a backend at the same time.

The goal for this week was to build authentication for both backend and frontend in a secure and defensive way, protecting and storing sensitive information in a protected way.
This was such a interesting and educational project! It was an good opportunity to understand and learn more regarding the importance of security and how to implement and simultaneously work with both frontend and backend.

We feel satisfied with the endresult of this week and are also looking forward to use the knowledge we gained from this project in the future.

Must-have requirements:

☑️ The API should have routes to register and login, and finally an authenticated endpoint.

☑️ The authenticated endpoint should return a 401 or 403 with an error message if you try to access it without an Authentication access token or with an invalid token.

☑️ The frontend should have a registration form which POSTs to the API to create a new user.

☑️ The passwords in the database should be encrypted with bcrypt.

☑️ The API should validate the user input when creating a new user, and return error messages which could be shown by the frontend.


## 🚧  The problem

We started by sketching out the different components to create a basic structure for the app. To understand the project we worked together with a mob-programming approach, creating the entire structure for the backend. For the frontend we worked separately on different timeschedules which made the communcation between us important and it worked out perfectly.

If we had more time, we would have challenged ourselves more and try to implement Google authentication with Firebase and also create a POST route for the logged in user to add new objects in the database.
